# unity-plugins-test

This is a test about creating a rendering plugin for [Unity](http://unity3d.com). When used together, we get a scene with some models rendered by Unity and some others rendered by the plugin itself.

## Initializing the project

1. Install dependencies.
2. Go to directory "RenderingPlugin" and build the plugin using CMake.
3. Open UnityProject/ in Unity and enjoy!
